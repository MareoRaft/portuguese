t
The "t" is a "flat" t, meaning that it's not as sharp/pronounced as a regular t.  It's sharper than a d but flatter than a t.  I put my tongue under and touching my front teeth, reaching slightly farther forward than my teeth do and pronounce a strong d or a weak t.  Compared to a strong t where the is a sudden strong release of pressure/air at the top teeth.

te
When NOT at the end of words, it's normal.  At the end of words, it's "chee".  This includes words that end with an s (plural).
- telefone      (telefonee)
- entender      (enteindeh)
- inteligente   (intelijeinchee) (the j here is a soft j)

ti
ALWAYS "chee"
- tia        (chee-a)
- dentista   (den-chee-sta)
- Haiti      (aye-chee) ("aye" is in "Aye, Matey" or the word eye)




de

lh / nh
lh pronounced like "li" and rapid.
nh pronounced like "ni" and rapid.







-o
If an "o" is at the END of a word, it's pronounced "u", and short and not emphasized (to the point where o and u sound almost identical anyway).  This means that the WORD "o" is pronounced as a "u" too.
Ex:
- O prazer é todo meu
- Eu posso ver o prazer
- Eu posso ver o gato
- sonho    (son-you) (where the "on" is a nasal french on, not an English on)



r-, -r, r(cons), rr
ALL Rs with EXCEPTIONS BELOW are pronounced like an English h!!!
Note that -r has an exception if the next word starts with a vowel.  It's about the sound.
Examples:
- errado          (ehado)  (This is a DOUBLE r so it is NOT an exception)
- correta         (co-heh-ta, with the flat t)
- reunião
- repita          (pronounced heh-pee-tah)
- regra            heh-gra      (note that the SECOND r is pronounced because it's ra)
- rápido          (hapido) (even though it's an a it's still an h sound)
- eu recomendo    (eu hecomendo) (even though vow in front, still h sound bc r at beginning of word)
- indeterminado   (indetehminado)
- terceira        (teh-seh-ra) (with Spanish ra)
- refazer         (hefazeh)
- accesar         (assessah)

- portugués       (pronounced pohtooghes in North East Brazil but portooghes in South Brazil)


ur(cons) / or(cons),  (cons)r(vow) / (vow)r(vow)
For SINGLE r followed by an a or o, the r is pronounced as in Spanish.
For a consonant other than r followed by r then a vowel, same.
For a vowel followed by r, followed by another vowel (the last vowel can even be in THE NEXT WORD), same.
Examples:
- para         (pronounced like Spanish para)

- ler o        (the word "ler" followed by the word "o".  here it's pronounced hard!)




ss
Pronounced like an English s.  How much you dwell I think depends on which vowel is accented in the word.
Ex:
- russo  (husso) (with Italian u)




(vow)s(vow)
Pronounced like an English z.
Ex:
- divisão  (jee-vee-zao)



-z
A "z" at the end of a word is pronounced "s".
Ex:
- talvez  (tau-vess) (with the semi-d type of t, the "au" like in "ouch!", and the accent on the first syllable)




exc / ixc / óxi
The soft version of xs (proceeded by e or i) is pronounced s.  (Like a real s, NOT a z sound)
Examples:
- excelente    (esselenchee)
- exceptional  (essepsionow)
- próximo      (prossimo)


exe, exa
The x is pronounced like a z.
- exemplo     (ezeimplo)
- exatamente  (ezatameinchee)






l(vow)
Pronounced normally.  It has a bit of action on the tongue but NOT an "li" sound.



(vow)l
The "l" at the *end* of a syllable is pronounced as a "u".  FOR ANY VOWEL, EVEN e/i.  By "end of syllable", I mean before a consonant or at the end of a word.  If speaking quickly it is hard to notice.  For example, if an l is at the end of a word or followed by a consonant, it's not pronounced.
Examples:
- desculpa  (can be pronounced descupa or jiscupa)
- alto      (auto)
- hotel     (oteu)
- azul      (azoo)
- til       (chiu)
- Brazil    (braziù)




en
Nasal "en" sound similar to "ein".  The n is completely nasal.  You can hear it but not like a regular n.
Ex:
- dentro  (deintru)




-om
When "om" is at the end of a word, it is pronounced bo(n) with a dipthong, much like french.  So the mouth goes into an n/m sound but does not pronounce the actual m itself.
Examples:
- som
- garçom
- coupom



j
Always makes the soft je sound.

ge / gi
Always makes the soft je sound.

go / ga / gu
Always makes the hard g sound coming from the back of the throat, like in Italian.




qui / que
Like Spanish.
